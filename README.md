# CreditcardFrauddetection
Credit Card Fraud Detection System
This project is a fully functional Credit Card Fraud Detection System built using Python. The primary aim of this system is to identify fraudulent transactions by analyzing the patterns and behaviors of credit card transactions. The system integrates both rule-based and machine learning approaches to detect anomalies in transaction data, ensuring a more robust fraud detection mechanism.

Key features of the project include:

User-friendly Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows easy interaction with the system, including input fields for name, bank name, and credit card details.

Transaction Categorization: The system categorizes transactions into entertainment, food, bills, and personal for better analysis.

Fraud Detection: A combination of rule-based and machine learning methods to identify fraudulent activities based on transaction patterns.

Visualization: The project provides visualizations (like pie and bar charts) to showcase transaction categories and fraud detection results.

Login System: A simple login system that supports multiple users with hardcoded client IDs and passwords.

Smarter Fraud Detection: The fraud detection system has been upgraded with a smarter model, capable of processing 200+ transactions and detecting fraud more accurately.

The project is designed to simulate real-world use cases in fraud detection systems, providing a foundational platform for further enhancements in security and data processing.
